### Date 9-29-21

Nick Curry - AWS - Software Development Engineer Apprentice

I attended this Employer meetup hosted by Vets in Tech. It was interesting because it was unique in the way that it was laid out compared to other employer meet-ups that I have attended.

- Section 1:  first part was introductions from each of the companies present about hiring opportunities they have to offer currently/ skills that they are pursuing - Security Clearances were high on the list for both Accenture and AWS. 

- Section 2: Panel discussion by select companies (Reddit, Nasdaq, and PNC) talking about "advice from recruiters" - which covered ways to break through the machine - biggest take away - Network

- Section 3: Breakout rooms - Each of the representative companies went to their respective rooms and held Q & A sessions with he attendees.

- I jumped to different room to listen and speak with the representatives that I found the most fascinating. Nick Curry has continued to be a great resource and has presented opportunities for transitioning military to attend an apprenticeship program, hosted by AWS. Great opportunity and Job ID: 1737350.
