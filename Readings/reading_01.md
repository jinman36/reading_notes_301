## Component Based Architecture

1. What is a component?

- per the article referenced " A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher level-interface"
- Which means its several lines of encapsulated code that is written in a way that can be applied to different scenerios but expected to act with, generally, the same behavior over and over.

1. What are the characteristics of a component?
  A component has 7 characteristics
    1. Reusability
    2. Replaceable
    3. Not Context Specific
    4. Extensible
    5. Encapsulated
    6. Independent

1. What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

- The primary objective is ensuring **component reusability**
- Ease of Deployment
- Reduced cost
- Ease of dev
- modification of technical complexity
- reliability
- system maintenance and evolution
- independent
