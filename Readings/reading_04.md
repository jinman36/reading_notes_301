## React Docs - lists and keys

1. [React Docs - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

1. [JavaScript — The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained](https://codeburst.io/javascript-the-conditional-ternary-operator-explained-cac7218beeff)

  }

Rewritten as ternary:
x===y ? 'Yes" : 'No";
