Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
SQL:
1. relational Databases (RDBMS)
2. Table based database
3. Predefined schema
4. vertically scalable
5. uses (structured query language) for defining and manipulating th data.
NoSQL:
1. Non-relational or distributed database
2. Collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhere to.
3. dynamic schema for unstructured data
4. scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
5. queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (unstructured Query Language) 

What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
- non-hierarchical data

Give a real world example.
- SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.

What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Give a real world example.
Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
- NoSQL is better for hierarchical data storage
Which type of database is best for scalability?
- Depends on your resources. SQL is better to scale vertical by increasing the power of the hardware, whereas NoSQL is scalable by increasing the servers.

What does SQL stand for?
- structured query language

What is a relational database?

What type of structure does a relational database work with?
- SQL

What is a ‘schema’?
- fields that can be included in a table

What is a NoSQL database?
How does it work?
- no tables, but uses collections with documents, with key, value pairs

What is inside of a Mongo database?
- NoSQL
Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
- MongoDB - it is structured to your data, rather than needing information for every field.

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
-
