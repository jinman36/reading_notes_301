# Day 4

### Date 9-25-2021

# WRRC - Web Request Response Cycle
- Client Side
- Server Side (API)
  - API - Application Program Interface

- React live completely in the front end - when a client requests information it is a 'Get Request'

- REST - Representational State Transfer
  - Restful verbs

GET: Requesting Information
POST: Add Information
PUT: Modify Existing Information
DELETE: Delete Information
-------------
Data flows down in React

- The flow of data makes it difficult to change parent state - to get around this we will want to use functions to access parent state
