# WRRC - Web Request Response Cycle

- Client Side
- Server Side

- React live completely in the front end - when a client requests information it is a 'Get Request'

- REST - representational state
  - Restful verbs

GET: Requesting Information
POST: Add Information
PUT: Modify Existing Information
DELETE: Delete Information
-------------

Data flows down in React

- The flow of data makes it difficult to change parent state - to get around this we will want to use functions to access parent state
