# Day 5

### Date 9-30-2021

- .find()
  - A callback function that will go through the functions and look for a certain value - needs a comparison
    example format
        let beastTitle = this.state.beastData.find((item) => item.title === beastTitle);


- anonymous callback function - using a arrow function without an argument - this can be used inline for certain actions.


- Everything within the  class gets used - but it gets put together inside the render()

- between the class and render - functions - instance methods
- inside the render function you will only want to use local variables

- render has its own scope within the class

mdn javascript - array prototype . function - today is filter :)
